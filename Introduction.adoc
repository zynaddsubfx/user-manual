== Introduction

////
I'd say this section is a good place to give a very sparse high level idea of
what the synth is about, provide links to subsections, and provide a quickstart
////

ZynAddSubFX is a multi-platform open-source software sound synthesizer, providing a variety of sound creation options including:

* 3 core synthesis engines
* 10+ filter options
* LFOs/envelopes for modulation
* Microtonal support
* Multi-parameter automation support

ZynAddSubFX can be run both as a standalone application as well as a VST/LV2/DSSI plugin
within your favorite DAW. ZynAddSubFX can be controlled through multiple interfaces, though this manual
will focus on the Zyn-Fusion interface.


// Note: celestehorgan – I would actually suggest removng this section entirely. It will end up being hard to maintain in future/will get out of sync, and it doesn't add much.
=== About the User Manual

The Manual is divided into the following sections:

Introduction:: An overview of ZynAddSubFX, installation instructions, and quick start tutorials.
Basic:: Information on the ZynAddSubFX interface, synthesizer modules, synthesis engines, and more.
Advanced:: Information on performing advanced tasks in ZynAddSubFX.
Glossary:: A glossary of specific terms and words.
Routing Diagrams:: A set of signal routing diagrams which display the inner workings of the synthesizer.




=== Quick start

.Under Construction
WARNING: This section is under construction

.Section outline
* Focus on a single plugin host (i.e. Ardour) but keep host specific details to a minimum
* Show the steps to open the synth and how to load up a simple and (very
  importantly) a good sounding patch
* This would be the place to talk about some very simple key bindings as well as
  file load/save operations
* Really keep stuff basic here at the expense of repeating details which will be
  covered in more detail down the line
* The user should learn how to:
** open the program
** navigate the bank browser
** load a patch from a file
** save a patch
** Play with the virtual keyboard
** Play with a MIDI keyboard/host input if they have one (talk about MIDI
channels very briefly)

.Random thought
NOTE: It might make sense to have these "the user should learn X" goals stored
in a consistent place or at least in a consistent format for each section

////
XXX Each one of these bullet points should be expanded upon somewhere else IMO

* Zyn-Fusion is actually three synthesizers in one box - they can play together
* multitimbral: can play multiple patches at once using different MIDI channels, or simply layer then together for complex sounds
* we can layers sounds like no one else (parts, kits, addsynth voices, multiple engines)
* Built in effects
* 16 macro slots for automation or live control - everything can be automated (unlike the old ZynAddSubFX interface)

=== Tutorial One: The Super Saw

////
This may be something geared better for the ADsynth section rather than here,
but we've got to start somewhere
////

.Under Construction
WARNING: This section is under construction

.Goals
NOTE: This section will teach the absolute basics about Add synth, editing a
multi-voice ADD synth based instrument, the basics of the oscillator view,
copy/paste, unison, and the cutoff frequency of a filter (maybe).
Overall this should be a way to introduce a person with near zero knowledge
about synthesis and Zyn to instrument creation.

The previous section talked about how to load an use existing patches, but the
majority of the power of ZynAddSubFX is to tune synthesis parameters to create
new sounds and to adjust existing sounds to harmonize with the rest of the
instruments.
Now that you know how to load and use existing patches, let's take a look at how
to build new patches.


.Section Outline
* Sub Part 1: The oscillator
**  Get the user to navigate to the oscillator view
*** Talk briefly about harmonics and low/high frequency content
*** Get the user to change the shape to saw
**** Talk about waveform shapes
*** Get the user to change the waveform parameter to a classic rising up sawtooth wave
**** Look at the harmonics again
*** Prompt the user to play the sound and make a note about what it sounds like
* Sub Part 2: A Voice
** Prompt the user through the process of creating the same sawtooth on voice 2
*** This should be used to re-enforce the process
** Move to voice parameters
*** Move to frequency parameters
*** Get them to change detune
*** Prompt the user to play
** Ask the user to repeat the process on voice 3 with notes about copy/paste for
    the oscillator

* Sub Part 3: A pause to talk about what a super saw really is
** Diagrams about signal routing
** Talk about what a unison is
* Sub Part 4: Putting it all together
** Tell user "Make a sawtooth"
** Show user unison control
** Say let's have some fun playing with this (reference harmonic information
    from part 1 and general super-saw notes from part 3) to motivate next step
** As an optional exploration subsection show low pass filter cutoff and
    basically say it sounds different, but near zero details here (that's
    reserved for a later tutorial)

NOTE: At this point there should be a small summary and a stepping stone for
the next area of the user manual
