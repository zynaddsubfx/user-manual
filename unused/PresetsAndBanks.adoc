==== What are presets?

Presets are a way of storing some settings on disk, to allow restoring them back from the file later. They can be used to save your work or to share it with other people.

NOTE: When using Zyn-Fusion as a plug-in inside a host, usually the host will take care of storing and restoring your patch upon saving/loading your project. However you can still use the Zyn-Fusion's own preset system as a backup solution or to take the patch out of one host and bring it into another.
