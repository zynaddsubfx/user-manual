=== ADDSynth

image::imgs/add-synth.png[]

ADDSynth is ZynAddSubFX's additive synthesizer.

This is the most common synth of choice, and you should use it any time you need
more than one voice, modulation, or a simple, one-oscillator patch.

It features 8 voices,
each of which can be toggled using the power button in the top-left corner of the ADDSynth panel
or using the voice grid below the ADDSynth panel button.

This section is meant to be an intuitive explanation of various sections of ADDSynth.
If you haven't tried to use ADDSynth practically, please consult the tutorials.

==== Editing a voice -> VOICE tabs

So how do you actually start editing a voice?

Usually, you'll first hop into the <<synth-osc, oscillator editor>> and make your voice have the desired timbre!
As you could expect, this is done via the "Oscillator" tab.

Your voice might additionally require some modulation or a bit of unison, in which case, we'll move onto the "Modulation" and "Mod-Osc" tabs!

In "Modulation", you can set add unsion, which is great for choirs or harmonic-rich sounds, or make your sound crazy using frequency, phase, ring or some other type of modulation. In case you want to change the modulating oscillator, you can do so in <<synth-osc, the "Mod-Osc" tab>> or by using one of the previous voices to modulate the current voice (e.g. voice 3 can be modulated by voices 1 and 2)!
This is done by setting the dropdown displaying "Normal" to the desired oscillator.

Once you have your desired sound, we move onto the "Voice" tab, where you can edit
the <<synth-ampset, amplitude>>. <<synth-freqset, frequency>>,
as well as the optional <<synth-filset, filter>>.

==== Editing global parameters

Now, once you've made each voice sound like how you want them, let's make the final sound!

First, you might want to go to the "Voice list" tab and adjust the voice levels!
Additionally, you can enable anti-aliasing and set panning, detune and MIDI CC vibrato depth.

After that, apply the finishing touches by going to "Global" and "Resonance" tabs and making changes to
the <<synth-ampset, amplitude>> and <<synth-freqset, frequency>>,
as well as the optional <<synth-res, resonance>> and <<synth-filset, filter>>.
