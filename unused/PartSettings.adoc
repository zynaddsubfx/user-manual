=== Introduction

Part settings - among other things - let you determine how the part will respond to incoming MIDI data. Settings like MIDI channel, mono/poly/legato or portamento reside here. Here you can also define a custom microtonal tuning or split the keyboard between different parts.

=== What are parts?

ZynFusion is a multitimbre synthesizer - that means it can perform with multiple patches (timbres) at the same time. All 16 parts function independently and by default respond to respective MIDI channels. Sound output from all part is mixed to a stereo sum.

=== Naming parts

Each part has a unique number, which cannot be changed, but can also be assigned a name. It's useful to name your parts when using more than one to keep things organized.

To name a part, just click in the Part List and type in a name:
