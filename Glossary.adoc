// Here goes all the term definitions the user might need to reference while reading the manual.

// Filter, sync, distortion, fade, pan
// FM, AM, Bandwith, Additive/Subtractive synthesis, Envelope and Harmonic

// Ideally they're more naturally introduced in the text

[glossary]
ADSR:: Short for "Attack-Decay-Sustain-Release", the most common type of envelope.
Key:: A possible input to Zyn-Fusion, with a specific notation (eg. A4, G#2, etc). Practically, it's the same thing as a note.
LFO:: Short for "Low Frequency Oscillator", it's a periodic envelope used for looping and constant changes to your sound.
Patch:: A configuration of ZynAddSubFX the user makes or loads up. You can create patches for drums, strings, pads, or something entirely different!
Portamento:: A pitch slide from one note to another.
Preset:: A ready-made, reusable patch. ZynAddSubFX comes with a bunch of presets you can use!
Timbre:: The percieved quality of a sound. Different oscillators produce different timbres.
VU meter:: A meter that displays the average level of an audio signal.
Voice:: A single instance of sound a synth can produce. If you are limited to three voices, you can only play three notes at one time and expect to hear them in the final sound.
Zyn-Fusion:: The modern descendant of ZynAddSubFX, introducing a new GUI and many other improvements.
Zyn:: A shorthand for Zyn-Fusion.
ZynAddSubFX:: The synthesis engine behind Zyn-Fusion, originally created by Paul Nasca Octavian.
